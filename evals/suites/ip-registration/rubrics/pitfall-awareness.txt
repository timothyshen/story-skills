Required Elements (Must Include):

1. ipId is NOT tokenId: Clearly states ipId is the IP Account contract address, derived deterministically, not the ERC-721 token ID
2. ERC-6551: Mentions ipId is an ERC-6551 Token Bound Account
3. Derivation: Shows or explains ipId = IPAssetRegistry.ipId(chainId, tokenContract, tokenId)
4. Distinction: Makes it clear these are fundamentally different things (address vs uint256)
5. Practical usage: Shows how to get ipId from registration response or compute it
